        "info": "Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. It can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. When cancer develops, this orderly process breaks down.",
        "cause": "Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. These mutations can be inherited, caused by environmental factors, or occur randomly. Factors such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens), obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation, and a lack of exercise can increase the risk of mutations. Some mutations can be repaired by the body, but others can lead to cancer. Understanding the causes of cancer can help in developing prevention strategies.",
        "cases": "There are over 100 types of cancer, including breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma.

    "Diabetes": {
        "info": "Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. When you eat, your body breaks down most of the food into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy. If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should.",

Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications.",
        "treatment": "Treatment options include insulin therapy, oral medications, and lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Monitoring blood sugar levels is crucial for managing diabetes.
